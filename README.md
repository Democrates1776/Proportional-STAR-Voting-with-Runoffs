# Proportional-STAR-Voting-with-Runoffs
I made a Proportional STAR Voting Python Program, except it has runoffs after every round. Instead of the highest scored candidate in a round winning a round, the top 2 candidates in a round face off in a runoff. A ballot's weighted runoff vote goes to the candidate it gave more points to.

I thought it was weird regular Proportional STAR Voting didn't have automatic runoffs, since "Automatic Runoff" is half the acronym. I thought it would be good to make sure a majority of the people in a proportion preferred the winning candidate. 

Use: Just copy and paste the code into a Python Interpreter, run, and the program will ask you how many candidates are running, what their names are, how many seats can be won, and what the ballot scores are.
