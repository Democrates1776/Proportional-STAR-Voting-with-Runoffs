# Proportional-STAR-Voting-with-Runoffs
I made a Proportional STAR Voting Python Program, except it has runoffs after every round. Instead of the highest scored candidate in a round winning a round, the top 2 candidates in a round face off in a runoff. A ballot's weighted runoff vote goes to the candidate it gave more points to.
